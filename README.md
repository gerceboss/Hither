# Hither

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gerceboss/Hither.git
```

## Instructions:

1. Always pull before you push anything

2. If you have already made changes and forgot to pull, then first commit you changes locally and after that ,

```bash
git pull
```

If that works and no conflicts arise , youu are good to go , you can push your code.

If not , then you must be having conflicts, you can use `git rebase` command and resolve conflicts by choosing the code to keep on you code editor
